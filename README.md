## About
A Recipe Finder app/website that helps users find food recipes, complete with step-by-step instructions, with the ingredients available in their own kitchen. It is a 1-month project built over React using REST APIs for the first time. The project began with a team of four. However within the first 2 weeks, one of our members made an unxpected leave, turning our team into a trio.
